Description: REDCap Custodian simplifies data management activities on REDCap systems. It provides a framework for automating data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) work. It supports ETL work within a REDCap, between REDCap projects, between REDCap systems, and with the REDCap database. It provides an extensible set of R functions, a Docker image, and an Rstudio Project template upon which a REDCap team can build ETL tasks that serve their REDCap systems and customers.
