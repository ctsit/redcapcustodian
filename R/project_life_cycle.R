#' @description
#' get_project_life_cycle runs speedy queries against the REDCap log event
#' tables to get all of the events in the life cycle of every project on
#' the system.
#'
#' @details
#' The redcap_log_event table is among the largest redcap tables. In the test
#' instance where this script was developed, it had 2.2m rows The production system
#' had 29m rows in the corresponding redcap_data table. A row count in the
#' millions is completely normal. Fortunately, project history is easy to
#' extract by querying for a specific of list descriptions and that field is
#' indexed.
#'
#' All that said, the query for the large list of descriptions is very slow.
#' A much faster query is to query for `object_type == "redcap_projects"`.
#' What's more, this query can then be filtered by `ts >= start_date`` to make
#' it even faster and to allow incremental queries. This comes at a small
#' cost because these descriptions are not are not included when searching for
#' `object_type == "redcap_projects"`:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Create project (API)
#'   \item Create project folder
#'   \item Delete project bookmark
#'   \item Send request to copy project
#'   \item Send request to create project
#'   \item Send request to delete project
#'   \item Send request to move project to production status
#' }
#'
#' Among other things, their loss means we cannot tell who requested things or
#' when they requested it.
#'
#' Deletion Events Notes
#'
#' Every project deletion is composed of multiple events. The simplest event
#' is a deletion by a user followed by a permanent deletion by the system via
#' a cron job 30 days later. While admins can always do this, users are only
#' allowed to delete non-production projects. For production projects, users
#' must submit a request to delete.  An admin then deletes the project.  30
#' days later the system will permanently delete the project via a cron job.
#' As a project can be undeleted before the permanent deletion and/or changes
#' status, the above sequences can have sub-loops and intermingle.
#'
#' To address who wanted a project deleted and got it done, one must find the
#' last "Send request to delete project" or "Delete project" event to get the
#' username and the "Permanently delete project" event to verify the deletion.
#' If both a request and a delete event precede the "Permanently delete
#' project" event, the username on the request should be consider the
#' deleter. The admin who executed the task is just the custodian.
